# Diaspy MVP Hierarchy: Integrated Development Roadmap

## Vision Overview
Build toward AGI through hierarchical dialectics, where earlier MVPs provide tested components for more ambitious capabilities. Focus on internal dialectical processes that expose modeling assumptions rather than external tool verification.

## Integrated Hierarchy (Bottom-Up Development)

### MVP 1: Truth Verifier (Foundation - Confidence Building)
**Objective**: Establish reliable baseline dialectics for fact-checking through internal model oppositions

**Components to Develop**:
- Robust thesis-antithesis-synthesis pipelines
- Confidence scoring mechanism
- User-friendly interface for claim verification
- Curated test cases showing hallucination mitigation

**Success Criteria**:
- 90%+ accuracy on hallucination detection cases
- Clear visualization of dialectical reasoning
- Web/API integration for easy usage

**Technical Scope**:
- Extend existing binary mode with better metrics
- Add confidence scoring to responses
- Create test suites with hallucination scenarios

### MVP 2: Debate Coach (Educational Extension)
**Objective**: Teach dialectical reasoning by engaging users in the process

**Leverages**: MVP 1's verified pipelines
**New Features**:
- Interactive debate interface
- Socratic question generation
- Argument refinement workbench
- Critical thinking progression tracking

**Example Usage**:
```
User: "Capitalism is the best economic system"
System: Thesis - "Capitalism maximizes individual freedom..."
Antithesis - "But creates inequality..."
Synthesis - "Balanced view considering both aspects"
â†’ Socratic: "How would you counter this perspective?"
```

### MVP 3: Multi-Perspective Analyzer (Professional Tool)
**Objective**: Bring diverse domain expertise to complex decisions

**Integration**: Combines MVP 1 + 2 capabilities
**New Components**:
- Domain expert agents (pre-trained)
- Parallel processing pipelines
- Perspective comparison interfaces
- Ethical consideration frameworks

### MVP 4: AGI Playground (Research Platform)
**Objective**: Enable experimentation with emergent dialectical behaviors

**Leverages**: All previous MVPs
**Capabilities**:
- Custom agent mixture creation
- Emergent behavior tracking
- Multi-LLM integration support
- Hypothesis generation from dialectical tensions

### MVP 5: Novel Scientific Insights (Innovation Engine)
**Objective**: Generate novel hypotheses by challenging scientific modeling assumptions

**Peak Achievement**: Transcend individual model boundaries through dialectic

**Scientific Domains Priority**:
1. Materials science (energy storage, semiconductors)
2. Biology (evolutionary theory, neuroscience)
3. Physics (quantum-classical hybrids, complexity theory)
4. Systems theory (emergent phenomena, scaling laws)

## Development Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP 1 Foundation (Current Priority)
- Improve metrics and scoring
- Add comprehensive test cases
- Refine hallucination mitigation examples
- User interface for truth verification

### Phase 2: MVP 2 Extension
- Learn from MVP 1 usage patterns
- Add interactive elements
- Test educational effectiveness

### Phase 3: MVP 3 Integration
- Begin with MVP 1+2 + domain extensions
- Focus on use cases in consulting/decisions

### Phase 4: MVP 4 Exploration
- Enable customization capabilities
- Track emergent behaviors

### Phase 5: MVP 5 Innovation
- Apply to scientific domains systematically
- Measure novelty and usefulness

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Dialectal Purity**: Prioritize internal model conflicts over external verification
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Each MVP builds on previous capabilities
3. **User-Centric Design**: Make critical thinking processes accessible
4. **Scientific Focus**: Material/Biology for tangible innovation validation
